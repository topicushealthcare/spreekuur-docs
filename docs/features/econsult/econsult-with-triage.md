## Functional summary
When e-consult with triage functionality is enabled for an organisation, patients will be triaged before they can submit 
an e-consult. The triage process is done by a questionnaire that is filled in by the patient. Based on the answers given by the
patient an urgency will be determined. Based on that urgency the patient will either see a self-care advice, can start a chat (see [chats functionality](/features/chat/chats)) 
or will be advised to contact the practice by phone.

When a chat is started, the triage data will be sent to the XIS. The triage data contains:
- The answers of the questionnaire
- Urgency
- Automatically generated s-line (subjective journal line)
  - The S line (or "s regel") is the subjective perception of the patient about his/her complaints. 
    See https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOEPstatus (in Dutch) for more information.

## Starting an e-consult with triage
To start an e-consult with triage, the flow is as follows:
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    actor Patient (User)
    participant Spreekuur.nl
    participant XIS
    participant Chat server
    
    Patient (User)->>Spreekuur.nl:(1) Start e-consult
    Patient (User)->>Spreekuur.nl:(2) Fill in triage questionnaire
    Spreekuur.nl->>Spreekuur.nl:(3) Determine urgency and S-line
    alt urgency is high
        Spreekuur.nl->>Patient (User):(4) Advise to call practice
    else urgency is medium
        Spreekuur.nl->>Chat server:(5.1) Start chat
        Spreekuur.nl->>XIS:(5.2) Send triage data to XIS as FHIR Bundle <br/> with QuestionnaireResponse and Observation resource
        Spreekuur.nl->>Patient (User):(5.3) Show chat in app
    else urgency is low
        Spreekuur.nl->>Patient (User):(6) Show self-care advice
    end
```
_Note: The exact followup action on a urgency level depends on the organisation type and settings. This is just an example
and illustrates all the possible followup actions._

1. The patient starts an e-consult in the Spreekuur.nl app.
2. The patient fills in the triage questionnaire.
3. Spreekuur.nl determines the urgency based on the answers given by the patient and generates an s-line.
4. If the urgency is high, the patient is advised to call the practice (triage out)
5. If the urgency is medium, a chat is started and the triage data is send to the XIS.
    1. A chat session is started in the chat service (see [chat functionality](/features/chat/chats))
    2. The triage data is send to the XIS as a FHIR Bundle containing a QuestionnaireResponse resource with the answers given by the patient and an Observation resource with the determined urgency.
    3. The patient can see the chat in the Spreekuur.nl app.
6. If the urgency is low, a self-care advice is shown to the patient.
